    # ðŸ“Œ 1. What is a Database?

A **Database** is:

> An organized collection of data stored electronically, which can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

| --------- | ------ | --- | ----- |
| 1         | Chirag | 16  | 11    |
| 2         | Aisha  | 15  | 10    |

This database helps you **store** and **organize** student information.
